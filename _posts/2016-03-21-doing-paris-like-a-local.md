Before Airbnb became popular, there was a service I used in Paris and still use to this day: ParisAutrement.com. They rent apartments exclusively in the Marais area of Paris (3rd and 4th arrondissements) and I've never had a bad experience with them.

You can rent for two days or months at a time and the price is much cheaper than staying at a hotel.

This experience is not for everyone if you are looking for the pampering that a hotel provides, but I've found it a great way to stay in a beautiful neighbourhood and truly get the local experience.

The Marais is a very nice part of the city, with many fancy shops and galleries but it also has a lot of cafes, fish markets, cheese shops, bakeries, grocery stores and wine stores to be able to pick up quick supplies in between exploring the city.

Every apartment I've stayed in through Paris Autrement has been in a very walkable area and only a few blocks away from the Seine depending on which apartment you rent. There are also plenty of Metro stops close by which makes exploring the city very easy.

I've stayed in a one-room studio when traveling alone and beautiful one bedrooms when traveling with my husband. In each case, we provided our estimated time of arrival to the address and were met by an employee who let us in and gave us a house tour and left the key with us.

The service we've dealt with has been great: in one case the apartment we rented was unavailable and so they upgraded us to a bigger place at no extra cost. In another instance we did have issues with the internet and that was resolved quickly. Finally, to our delight when we arrived at the apartment for our honeymoon, the woman who met us had brought a bottle of champagne to give us as a congratulations.

Overall, I love the apartments that are offered through Paris Autrement, I have peace of mind with the staff and the level of service available and the neighbourhood is fantastic. I would recommend the site to anyone and would gladly stay with them again.
