It was Nunavut Day in Canada this past week, the anniversary of when the Parliament of Canada passed the Nunavut act and established the territory of Nunavut.

I reminisced on my trip there, when my mother and I traveled to Iqaluit and Qikiqtarjuaq to celebrate her 60th birthday. It seems like such a remote place to be a travel destination, but my mother's rationale was that she had seen every province our fine country has to offer but had never been to a Northern Territory. Since Nunavut was the most recently established territory, she wanted to visit that one.

We flew up there in April, but it was still very much winter in Nunavut. We flew there via Ottawa, as there are a lot of government workers that travel back and forth between Iqaluit and Ottawa. I began to see the frozen tundra as we were in the plane on the way there and little did I know that I would be bouncing around in a wooden box on some similar terrain only a few days later.

It was certainly the trip of a lifetime and I experienced being the coldest I've ever been for the first time in my life (the second time would be in a similarly remote, although more populated location) but also the first time I've really experienced the beauty and power of nature in a way that you never will in a heavy populated city.
